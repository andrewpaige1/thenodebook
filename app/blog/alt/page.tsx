					Quizlet has long been the go-to platform for digital flashcards, but as learning needs evolve, students are searching for more effective, engaging, and holistic study tools. If you’re looking for Quizlet alternatives that help you truly understand—not just memorize—your coursework, you’re not alone.
				</p>

				<h2>Why Look Beyond Quizlet?</h2>
				<p className="mb-6">
					While Quizlet is great for quick review and rote memorization, it often falls short when it comes to deeper learning. Many students find themselves memorizing terms for a test, only to forget them soon after. What’s missing? Context, connections, and active engagement with the material.
				</p>

				<h2>Popular Quizlet Alternatives</h2>
				<ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
					<li><strong>Anki:</strong> Powerful spaced repetition, but a steep learning curve and limited collaboration features.</li>
					<li><strong>Brainscape:</strong> Clean interface and adaptive learning, but less focus on conceptual connections.</li>
					<li><strong>Cram:</strong> Simple flashcard creation, but lacks advanced study modes and visualization tools.</li>
				</ul>
